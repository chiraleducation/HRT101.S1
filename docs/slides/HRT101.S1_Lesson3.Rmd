#  Research Data Management(RDM)



---
## What is Research Data Management(RDM)?
- Research data management (RDM) refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project

--

- It covers initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing.

---
## Why Research Data Management(RDM)
To ensure that research data are: 

--

- Secure 

--

- Sustainable 

--

- Reusable  



---
## What is Research Data?
> **Research Data**<br>
> Any information collected or generated for the purpose of analysis, in order to generate or validate scientific claims. 

---
## Types of Research Data?
Research data can be classified in different ways: 
--

- Content - Numerical, textual, audiovisual, multimedia, etc. 

--

- Format - Spreadsheets, databases, images, maps, audios, files, and unstructured text. 

--

- Methods - Experimental, observational, simulation, derived. 

--

- Nature - Digital(born-digital or digitized) or non-digital(paper surveys)

--

- Source - Primary, secondary 

--

- Processing - Raw, processed 



---
## Steps in Research Data Management(RDM)
- Planning 

--

- Collecting 

--

- Organizing 

--

- Documenting 

--

- Storing 

--

- Backing-up 

--

- Preserving 

--

- Sharing 


---
## Research Data Lifecycle 

- Before Research - Planning 

--

- During Research - Collecting, Organizing, Documenting, Storing, Backing-up 

--

- After Research - Sharing, Preserving 



---
## Benefits of Managing and Sharing Data
- Minimizing your risk of losing valueable data 

--

- Increasing your research efficiency 

--

- Facilitating collaborative research 

--

- Supporting research quality and integrity 

--

- Enhancing the visibility and impact of your research 

--

- Complying with(external) data requirements 

--

- Accelerating scientific discovery

--

- Increasing return on investment

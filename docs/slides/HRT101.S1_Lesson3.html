# Academic Phrasebank

---
## What is Academic Phrasebank? 
&gt; Academic phrasebank refers to a library containing a collection of English phrases that can be readily used in scientific papers and academic reports.

# How to Read a Scientific Paper Quickly? 

---
## Three Pass Approach 
Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass:

--

-  The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. 

--

- The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details

--

- The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

.footnote[
[Adapted from Keshav, Srinivasan. "How to read a paper." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 37.3 (2007): 83-84.]()] 

---
## Three Pass Approach: The First Pass
- The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of
the paper.

--

- You can also decide whether you need to do any
more passes.

--

- This pass should take about five to ten minutes
and consists of the following steps:
  - Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
  - Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore
  everything else
  - Read the conclusions
  - Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the
ones you’ve already read
.footnote[
[Adapted from Keshav, Srinivasan. "How to read a paper." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 37.3 (2007): 83-84.]()
]



---
## Three Pass Approach: At The End of First Pass
You should be able to answer the five Cs:

--

1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A
description of a research prototype?

--

2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which
theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?

--

3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?

--

4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?

--

5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

.footnote[
[Adapted from Keshav, Srinivasan. "How to read a paper." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 37.3 (2007): 83-84.]()
]


---
## Three Pass Approach: The Second Pass
- In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but
ignore details such as proofs.

--

-  It helps to jot down the key points, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

--

- Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. 

--

- Pay special attention to graphs.

--

- Are the axes properly labeled? 

--

- Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are - statistically significant? 

--

- Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

--

- Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

.footnote[
[Adapted from Keshav, Srinivasan. "How to read a paper." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 37.3 (2007): 83-84.]()
]

---
## Three Pass Approach: The Third Pass
- To fully understand a paper, particularly if you are re-
viewer, requires a third pass. 

--

- This pass requires great attention to detail. 

--

- This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners,
and about an hour for an experienced reader.

# Scientific Paper: Identifying Location

---
## Identifying Location: 4 Phages 
- Phage 1: To know the summary of a paper
  - Read the abstract first(objectives, methods, results, conclusions) 

--

- Phage 2: If interested in what this paper is all about 
  - Read last paragraph of introduction(research questions, research hypothesis &amp; objectives)  

--

- Phage 3: If interested in summary findings
  - Read first paragraph of discussion and conclusion

--

- Phage 4: If interested in strengths and limitations of the study
  - Read the last paragraph of discussion

#  Research Data Management(RDM)


---
## What is Research Data Management(RDM)?
- Research data management (RDM) refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project

--

- It covers initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing.

.footnote[

]


---
## Why Research Data Management(RDM)
To ensure that research data are: 

--

- Secure 

--

- Sustainable 

--

- Reusable  



---
## What is Research Data?
&gt; **Research Data**&lt;br&gt;
&gt; Any information collected or generated for the purpose of analysis, in order to generate or validate scientific claims. 

---
## Types of Research Data?
Research data can be classified in different ways: 
--

- Content - Numerical, textual, audiovisual, multimedia, etc. 

--

- Format - Spreadsheets, databases, images, maps, audios, files, and unstructured text. 

--

- Methods - Experimental, observational, simulation, derived. 

--

- Nature - Digital(born-digital or digitized) or non-digital(paper surveys)

--

- Source - Primary, secondary 

--

- Processing - Raw, processed 



---
## Steps in Research Data Management(RDM)
- Planning 

--

- Collecting 

--

- Organizing 

--

- Documenting 

--

- Storing 

--

- Backing-up 

--

- Preserving 

--

- Sharing 


---
## Research Data Lifecycle 

- Before Research - Planning 

--

- During Research - Collecting, Organizing, Documenting, Storing, Backing-up 

--

- After Research - Sharing, Preserving 



---
## Benefits of Managing and Sharing Data
- Minimizing your risk of losing valueable data 

--

- Increasing your research efficiency 

--

- Facilitating collaborative research 

--

- Supporting research quality and integrity 

--

- Enhancing the visibility and impact of your research 

--

- Complying with(external) data requirements 

--

- Accelerating scientific discovery

--

- Increasing return on investment

# Managing and Organizing Information 

- Folder Structure 
- Sample Project
    - Word Documents 
    - Research Articles 
    - Questionnaires 
    - Datasheets 
- Files Inside the Folder 
  - Research Articles - `name_of_author_year_keywords.pdf` 
  - Word Documents(version1) - `name_of_file_year_v1.docs` 
  - Word Documents(version2) - `name_of_file_year_v2.docs`
